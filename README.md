# pythoncalculator
Just a python calculator for fun and learning

TODO:
- Implement getting numbers from button presses
- Handle what operation the user chooses
- Implement clear button
- Remove divide_whole since we can just check if the number is an integer
- Make it pretty (maybe follow Apple's calculator theme?)
- Stretch goal: Implement PEMDAS (using () buttons) , % button, Pi button, trig functions, root functions, etc. (more scientific functions)
